# Overview

This two-session introduction to orienteering is designed to take participants from complete beginners to having practical experience in the sport. The first session focuses on classroom learning of fundamental concepts, while the second session provides hands-on outdoor practice.

## Session Structure

- **Session 1 (Classroom)**: 1 hour of theory, map reading basics, and sport overview
- **Session 2 (Outdoor)**: 1 hour of practical skills application in a controlled environment

# Session 1: Classroom Introduction (1 Hour)

## What is Orienteering? (10 minutes)

Orienteering is a sport that combines navigation skills with physical fitness. Participants use a detailed map and compass to navigate through unfamiliar terrain, finding a series of control points in the shortest possible time.

### Key Elements:
- **Map**: Detailed topographic map with specific orienteering symbols
- **Compass**: Navigation tool for direction finding
- **Control Points**: Marked locations to be visited in sequence
- **Terrain**: Natural outdoor environments (forests, parks, urban areas)

## Types of Orienteering (15 minutes)

### 1. **Foot Orienteering**
- Traditional form using running/walking
- Most common type for beginners
- Various distances from sprint to marathon

### 2. **Mountain Bike Orienteering (MTBO)**
- Navigation on mountain bikes
- Requires bike handling + navigation skills
- Longer distances, different terrain considerations

### 3. **Ski Orienteering**
- Winter sport combining cross-country skiing with navigation
- Specialized maps and equipment
- Popular in Nordic countries

### 4. **Trail Orienteering**
- Precision navigation without running
- Accessible for all abilities
- Focus on map reading accuracy

### 5. **Urban Orienteering**
- City-based navigation
- Uses street maps and urban features
- Great for beginners and accessibility
